CPSC 335-02 Project 2 - Sort Race

Members: Zach Hofmeister, Youssef Chahine, Jonathan Hana

Intro

	This project is a sort racing program between 4 algorithms: Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Gold's Pore Sort.
	The goal for this project is to display each algorithm, side-by-side, sorting a selected string, including rotations of the string after a full pass.
	This is done by running through an algorithm, a single pass, displaying the result of the pass, then moving onto the next algorithm. The cycle continues.
	When a string is sorted, it will show the entire row of the relative pass as the same color, where as unsorted passes will have different lighting values of the color it shares.
	
	You can select a different input string with the left and right arrow keys. This will choose an input string that's adjacent to the current string with the "inputs" array.
	
	This is designed to run on your browser, so there is no need to install any programs for it to work.
	To get started, just double-click the "sortRace.html" file for it to run on your browser; you can also drag-and-drop it onto your browser.
	You also do not need to worry about building it, it will simply just run after any code changes.
	You do however need to refresh the page if you make any code changes while the page is open, in order to see active changes.
